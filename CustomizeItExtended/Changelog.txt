Version 1.6.2 - 

Added Compatibility Patch for Advanced Vehicle Options 1.9

Version 1.6.1 - 

Fixed ArrayOutOfBounds Issue

Version 1.6.0 -

Upgraded:

Harmony Patch System to Version 2.0
Sunset Harbor DLC Compatibility.

Version 1.5.0 - 

New Features:

Vehicle Selection - You can now select ANY loaded vehicle from within a Vehicles Customize It Extended Panel. This means you no longer have to go searching for the vehicles on the map. Simply pick one, and then change your selection. This is BETA, and as such
the UI isn't perfect, it will be cut off at certain points, and the entire vehicle name may not fit in the box. The list will also update upon default name changing, and display the currently used default name(if applicable). There is also currently no categories,
as such all vehicles will appear in the same list (including trailers and disasters). 

Currently if you have more than one vehicle with the same name, it will only show ONE vehicle in the list. This can be mitigated by using the Absolute Names option in the options menu.

Changed:

UI - The Customize It Extended Panel will no longer close on selecting a different building or vehicle. This has been implemented in order to accomodate the selection features above.

Version 1.4.6 - 

Moved: 

 Default Naming has been moved to Customize Extended It Panel - This was done in order to consolidate all editable fields into one panel. It also has the added benefit of clearing up the Info Panels, and removing the default name checkbox.
 Renaming a Building Normally when a default Name has been set will `unsubscribe` that building from the default naming scheme.

Version 1.4.5 - 

New Features:

- German Translation -  A German Translation can now be activated from the options menu. Note this requires a game restart to change the options text. Credit to 7R0J4N for the translation.

Version 1.4.1 - 

New Features:

-  Import and Export a Default City Config - Import and Exporting is only available when you use the Save Per City option. This allows you to export your current city settings to an external file so you can load it 
back up on a new city. It allows the transfer of settings between citys without resorting to using your settings on All Cities. Note - Importing a default config will override your current city settings.

Bug Fixes:

- Updated Serialization Routines. It should be more stable now and not cause TypeLoadErrors.
- Moved Service Customize It Button to account for Landfills, and anything else with an empty button.
- Moved Various Default Name Checkboxes to account for the Notification Banner.



Version 1.4.0 - 

New Features:

- Default Names - You now have the option to set a Default Name for Buildings and Vehicles. You must rename the building/vehicle first, and then toggle the checkbox.
  If a building/vehicle has a default name, any building/vehicle of the same type will spawn/plop with that name. It will also change the name of any that have already spawned/plopped.
- Vehicle Manager - Vehicles now have a properties button allowing you to alter various values.
- Citizen Manager - Citizens now have a properties button. This currently allows you to view various statistics about the selected Citizen. These values apart from `Job Title` are for information only, and are not current editable.
- Custom Job Names - Citizens can now have Custom Job Names. From the new properties button, you can alter the `Job Title` field for a custom job name.
